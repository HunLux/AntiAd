This is a plugin allows you to prevent those anyoing advertisers stealing your people from your server. What it does is it waits for an IP, domain or spam in the chat and when someone types an IP it intercepts the message and says to the person [AntiAd] DO NOT ADVERTISE! and gives them their first strike, the player by default has 3 chances and on the last chance will be punished using a command outputed from the console, this is editable in the config, It also sends a message to everyone with the permissions node: antiad.see, and tells them who advertised and what the IP was so admins and moderators can take appropriate action.
There is a Secondary feature that prevents spam, Long excessive words 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' for example and it also blocks people writing in caps.
